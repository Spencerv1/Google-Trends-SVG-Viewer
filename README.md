# Google-Trends-SVG-Viewer
View .SVG files in google trends.

## Usage
Create a new directory named "svgs" in the root folder and add your svg files named [file number].svg.

The program will send a number of frames per second to be rendered in a browser, which is 24 by default. This can be changed in line 14 of app.py. 

Connect to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser to see your SVG files in google trends.
